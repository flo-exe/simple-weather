# Simple Weather

This is a simple weather application displaying real-time weather information based on user search input. It utilises HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to fetch data using the OpenWeatherMap API, summarising it into a clean, modern interface.

## Future updates

I hope you like my simple weather app. My goal for this one was a clean user interface that was not too complicated in terms of functionality. 

In the future I am considering interface updates, including adding a background that is responsive to weather conditions, but for now I am keeping it minimalist.
